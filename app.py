            - **Competitor URL(s)**: {competitors_url}
            - **Product Category**: {product_category}
            - **Value Proposition**: {value_proposition}
            - **Target Customer**: {target_customer}

            ### Additional Requirements:
            - **Document Insights**: Extract and incorporate relevant information from the uploaded file `{document_text}` to enhance the analysis.

            - Built-in cupholder.
            - High durability.
            - Competitive pricing at $400.
            - **Competitor Insights**: Use data scraped from `{data_source_url}` to identify competitors, their features, pricing, and durability.
            - add these findings in the table

            ### Tasks:
            1. **Company Strategy**:
            - Summarize the company's primary activities, priorities, and any recent initiatives or strategies.
            2. **Competitor Mentions**:
            - Extract and analyze data about competitors from the provided URLs and scraped data.
            - Create a very detailed comparison table that includes:
                - **Competitor Name**
                - **Features**
                - **Price**
                - **Durability**
                - **Comparison to Your Product** (Highlight unique selling points like 3D immersive experience, durability, and pricing advantages).
            - Example table format:
                | Competitor Name | Features                        | Price | Durability | Comparison to Your Product                      |
                |------------------|--------------------------------|-------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
                | Competitor A     | Basic ergonomic design         | $500  | Medium     | No 3D features, no cupholder, higher price     |
                | Competitor B     | Speakers, ergonomic design     | $450  | High       | Lacks 3D immersive experience and cupholder    |
                | Your Product     | 3D immersive, cupholder, etc.  | $400  | High       | Unique immersive experience; unbeatable value  |

            3. **Leadership Information**:
            - Identify key decision-makers in the company (e.g., CEO, CTO) and summarize relevant public statements or initiatives.
            4. **Product Insights**:
            - Emphasize the unique features and value propositions of your product based on the uploaded document and compare them with competitors.
            5. **Suggestions for Positioning**:
            - Provide clear recommendations for how the product can align with the company's strategy and address customer pain points.

            ### Final Output:
            - Use a professional, structured format with clear sections for company strategy, competitor mentions, leadership insights, and product value propositions.
            - Include references or links to any supporting data.

            ### Closing Statement:
            Conclude the report with a compelling statement emphasizing the product's competitive edge and alignment with the target company's goals. Example:
            "The unmatched combination of immersive experience, durability, and affordability positions this product as a market leader. We look forward to discussing how this innovative solution aligns with your company's goals."

            Close the analysis with:
